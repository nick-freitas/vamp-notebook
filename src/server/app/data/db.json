      "backgroundNote": "Macca’s never been to Alamut, but he’s seen it through a rifle scope. That’s close enough as far as he’s concerned. Macca has his own agenda, and it doesn’t involve kneeling before the Old Man in the Mountain. In life, Macca was a decorated soldier of the Australian Army. He signed up for the love of his country and the desire to fire big guns, but after two decades of service an offer of retirement arose, with a well-paid contract for a so-called “First Team” of mercenaries. He didn’t hesitate in applying for discharge. Macca’s time with the First Team changed him, as he repeatedly witnessed terrible atrocities, often perpetrated by the companies he was protecting. Several missions were civilian assassinations and, though he voiced objections, they went ahead and he played his part. Macca feared the First Team would execute his family back home if he showed a desire to back out. One wetworks objective had him shooting a target as she engaged in a nighttime meeting with her friends. The squad were to use hot rounds to send a message to the target’s group. Macca attempted to inform the target ahead of time, but his fellow mercenaries murdered her before he could send a warning. The victim’s allies easily tracked and attacked the hired guns, killing the shooter before seizing Macca. The target was a prophet, they said. Only she knew the route to Golconda, and her death set the group back centuries. An incredulous Macca didn’t believe a word, until he witnessed these vampires’ powers. He desperately pledged to avenge the victim’s death, but this wasn’t enough. Once Embraced and shown the capacity of his strengths and limitations as a vampire, the disciples made it clear: Macca must continue what his victim started. Macca’s time with the coterie resulted in his gaining a glimpse of Golconda. He now seeks clues to its path, and focuses his ire and rifle on eliminating those who would use Golconda as a means of manipulation. He’s got no time to listen to false prophets, so he punishes liars and charlatans in an effort to discover the pure road from among the weeds. Macca’s spent more time consorting with Camarilla loremasters than any other, and in turn has become a useful asset to the Sect. He’ll turn his guns on whoever he’s paid to kill, providing the target doesn’t conflict with his interests. He’s still hunted by the corporation that hired the First Team. Somehow, they know he’s not fully dead. The Australian Camarilla protect his family, and to date haven’t used them as blackmail against him. They know Macca’s more useful when happy and willing.",
      "descriptionNote": "Macca’s receding hairline, paunch, and shadowed eyes mean he’s not a looker. He’s stocky, and lopes lazily with his shoulders hunched. There’s something darkly appealing to him though, in the sinister smile between his moustache and chin strip, and the way his gaze never wavers. In his role as a killer for hire, Macca knows not to dress ostentatiously — unless the job requires it. He wears heavy jackets in which he can hold weapons, often carries a case, and has been known to wear rolled-neck sweaters just because they provide another place in which to hold a small explosive or blade.",
      "roleplayingHints": "Macca’s all business when talking about a hit. He doesn’t believe in joking about killing, even when he’s dismissive of a victim. He thinks death-related puns are the purview of soft sods who’ve not experienced war or fired a gun for a living. When on the subject of Golconda, Macca is sober. He’s not a true believer, but knows he must atone by allowing others to attempt to discover the path. He feels it’s his duty to protect those who seek the nigh-mythical state. Macca’s broad Australian accent is uncultivated. He’s proud of his heritage and speaks fondly of his time in the army and back home, despite feeling he can never return. He’s decidedly irreverent and tells vulgar anecdotes freely, when not caught on a somber topic.",
