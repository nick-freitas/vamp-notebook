    points: 2,
    description: `When the Tzimisce fled Eastern Europe, their clan weakness made it very difficult to sire, as the childe would be born with a dependence on soil from a homeland they had never known. Obtaining soil from this European homeland is often taxing, and gained at great difficulty. Your dependence on this precious soil should only be known to those who absolutely must know as it could one day be used against you.

    description: `When you were first brought before the prince, you flubbed the entire thing. Now you believe that the prince (whether true or not) disfavors you.

While not without goals of your own, the council and clan come first at all times. Should a member of the 7 (or any of their duly appointed representatives, or simply a higher ranking Tremere) command that you jump, you will jump, hoping to float, and praying that it was high enough. Succeeding in removing the bond (or even attempting to, for that matter) through any means available will mean an immediate call for your destruction. Should the bond be found incapable of keeping you in line, your destruction will be called for as well.`

You have the Short flaw automatically, and have a hard time having adults take you seriously as they see only a child. The thirst is also a bit difficult for you as you have never undergone any transformative period (puberty) in your life. Also, gaining access to restricted areas such as bars and night clubs may pose issue as you are "underage" `

  Compulsion: {

  Confusion: {
    points: 2,
    description: `To you, the world around you is a confusing place. A series of unknown twists and turns that boggle your mind at all times. This flaw must be roleplayed well for great effect.

When you awake each evening, you suffer 1 cumulative unsoakable bashing damage that cannot be healed with blood. In order to keep your rotting corpse from falling to pieces on you, you must consume 1/10th of your body weight in human flesh per level of damage suffered. How you acquire this flesh is up to you, but bear in mind, that the longer you let it go, the more your appearance suffers, the weaker you become, and that without the flesh to regenerate you, final death will take you.      `

You can never interact with mortals you don't intend to kill as, within one week of even touching you, they will contract the disease, develop symptoms and surely die. This poses a huge threat to the masquerade, and most princes would rather have your head than have a pandemic to deal with. Most other supernatural creatures can deal with the disease in their own way so you pose little threat to them.`

  'Cursed 1': {
    points: 1,
    description: `You have been supernaturally cursed. This curse is both dangerous, specific, and can be life threatening.

    description: `You are doomed to possibly the worst of all fates. This may come as final death or eternal agony, and is guaranteed to come to pass without fail. You have visions of the fate ahead of you that may cause discomfort or depression at times. What you do with your un-life prior is still up to you, but you know that no matter what you do you will end up in the worst of places. Players often find this flaw freeing as they know that ultimately it will end bad for their character anyway. Imagine having terminal cancer...is skydiving really that scary now?`
  },
  'Dark Secret': {
    points: 1,
    description: `You have a dark secret, that if uncovered, would make you a pariah in the kindred community. This brings you great shame, embarrassment, or both. You will do anything to keep your secret...anything.`

  Deaf: { points: 4, description: `You are Deaf. All rolls involving hearing are automatic failures.` },
  "Death's Reflection": {
    points: 3,
    description: `You cast a reflection (even as a Lasombra) that depicts you in the state that your body would be in had it continued to decompose. Young kindred with this flaw appear as dark eyed corpses, whereas elders may appear as shambling skeletons.`
  },
  Deathsight: {
    points: 2,
    description: `The world appears to you as a corpse in mid-decomposition. Mortals appear as walking diseased skeletons, buildings seem decrepit, and other kindred appear as walking cadavers. Everything dies, and you see that in everything. This makes it easier to resist appearance based powers, but rolls that involve you being social are harder.`
  },
  'Deep Sleeper': {
    points: 1,
    description: `You sleep very deeply and are hard to awaken. You never set appointments for the early evening and may be late to those you had no hand in setting.`
  },
  Deformity: {
    points: 3,
    description: `You are deformed or misshapen in some manner. A hunch back, clubbed foot, whatever. This deformity causes you great social anxiety and may affect you physically.`
  },
  'Diabolic Sire': {
    points: 2,
    description: `Your sire has taken part in some horrific act which has stirred uproar in the sect to which you belong. Killing elders, or wantonly breaking the masquerade may be on the list of your sires crimes, and this reflects poorly upon you causing you to be outcast or questioned, or accused of co-conspiracy even though this may be untrue.`
  },
  'Disease Carrier': {
    points: 3,
    description: `You carry an infectious disease in you blood such as HIV, or Rabies. Kindred who drink of your blood have a 10% to become carriers as well. You must spend a blood each night to avoid the symptoms of your disease. `

  Disfigured: {
    points: 2,
    description: `You have a horrible disfigurement which makes you stand out and easy to identify. Your appearance score is 0 much like the Nosferatu who cannot take this flaw.`
  },
  Disgrace: {
    points: 3,
    description: `Your sire considers your embrace a titanic mistake and is not shy about telling anyone how they feel in this regard. You are frowned upon in most of your sires social circles, degraded by their friends, and even when you do succeed, you efforts are often discredited.`
  },
  'Double Betrayer': {
    points: 4,
    description: `At some point in the past your character undertook the Vaulderie. You more than likely tried to join the Sabbat, and now bear the mark of the betrayer. You have since repented and have been welcomed back into the ranks of the Tremere, but to those who do not know you, you are a betrayer who heeds over-watch. As such others are almost always watching your every move, ready to report your slightest misgiving to the authorities. Should you fail in your reporting, or have a relapse in bad behavior your character will surely be hunted down and tried for your crimes.`
  },
  'Driving Goal': {
    points: 3,
    description: `You have personal goal that sometimes compels and drives you in mysterious ways. The goal is always limitless in depth and you can never truly achieve it. Your goal could be to eradicate the Sabbat or Camarilla entirely, or to unify all faiths into one. Because you must always be working toward you goal, this may get you into trouble, as if it came down to following orders or your goal you will most assuredly choose your goal. Choose your goal wisely as it will dictate how you play your character from start to finish.`
  },
  'Enemy of Office': {
    points: 4,
    description: `You have made an enemy of a superior kindred who holds office or power in your sect. This enemy does anything they can to make your existence miserable. Giving you the most demeaning of duty, or the most dangerous mission possible in the hope that you will not return, this enemy will stop at nothing. You may seek a way to make amends for your grievance, but this is never an easy task, as kindred can be petty and they can make you suffer for eternity should they wish it.  `
  },
  'Dulled Bite': {
    points: 2,
    description: `Your fangs did not develop properly during the embrace and are conicle and round at the tip. You must find a different way to make blood flow lest you risk seriously injuring your prey.`
  },
  'Enemy 1': {
    points: 1,
    description: `You have an enemy or group of enemies who wish to do you harm. The severity and power of the grudge is decided by how many points are taken into this flaw. A 5 may be a powerful prince and his Camarilla legion, and a 1 is most likely a single individual near your own power.`

  'Enemy 2': {
    points: 2,
    description: `You have an enemy or group of enemies who wish to do you harm. The severity and power of the grudge is decided by how many points are taken into this flaw. A 5 may be a powerful prince and his Camarilla legion, and a 1 is most likely a single individual near your own power.`

  },
  'Enemy Brood': {
    points: 3,
    description: `Although a Nosferatu yourself, you have done something to anger another brood of Nosferatu. They will do anything they can to make your un-life a living hell. You may run, but hiding is equally as difficult. Should you flee your city, the enemy brood will use their influence to make your ugly mug known to the sewer dwellers of the new city and they will treat you with the same disrespect.`
  },
  'Escaped Target': {
    points: 2,
    description: `You spent a significant time watching a mortal you had intended to embrace, and for one reason or another, someone else beat you to the punch. You are enraged at the fact that you were cheated out of your prize and will lash out (sometimes irrationally) at the thieving sire, or the new fledgling. Among kindred your disfavor of the thieving sire is well known and your temper is not looked upon well.`
  },
  Expendable: {
    points: 1,
    description: `Someone of power in your sect does not like the fact that you are around and will do anything they can to put you in precarious situations that may look bad, or that you may not make it out of at all. The aggressor has no remorse for trying to off you, and often chalks the danger they put you in as "for the good of the group"`
  },
  Failure: {
    points: 2,
    description: `During your first nights, you screwed up and broke the masquerade, and were caught doing so. You were however, saved, by another who now holds that failure over you. You, concerned with having your dirty secret revealed are at the mercy of your "savior"`
  },
  Fangless: {
    points: 2,
    description: `When you were embraced, you did not develop fangs. Instead, your mortal smile remained. Obviously, you now cannot use your fangs as a weapon, must find other ways to draw blood from prey lest you cause severe damage to them, and suffer a massive social stigma. After all "what kind of vampire doesn't have fangs?!"`
  },
  Flashbacks: {
    points: 6,
    description: `You have suffered some traumatic event that you survived. This may have been a huge accident or a near death experience. Whatever the cause, your mind is wrought with flashbacks to the time when it happened. These flashbacks are incapacitating, and leave you vulnerable, especially when confronted with a situation that is even close to what had happened to you in the past. During a flashback you are left to its mercy, and that of those around you. You will often shake, scream, or even lash out at others during the attack. Flashbacks can happen at anytime, anywhere, and storytellers are encouraged to use them for dramatic effect.`
  },
  'Flesh of the Corpse': {
    points: 5,
    description: `Although you may heal your wounds, you flesh bears permanent marks from every wound you have ever had. This causes social interactions to become more and more difficult as time goes on.`
  },
  'Former Prince': {
    points: 3,
    description: `You were once the prince of your home city, and for one reason or another you vacated the throne. Since then a new prince has come to power and, as is common in kindred society, is concerned with you. They may see you as a threat to their position of power as you may try to make a come back and usurp their throne. For this reason, the new prince may do anything in their power to rid themselves of you.`
  },
  'Glowing Eyes': {
    points: 3,
    description: `Your eyes glow like the vampire legends in mortal fiction. Although this makes it much easier to intimidate mortals, it does little to affect other supernatural beings. You are also a walking breech in the masquerade, and must always disguise your eyes with thick glasses or a face shield. We know what you're thinking...no contacts don't  work that way.    `
  },
  'Guilt Wracked': {
    points: 4,
    description: `You feel tremendous guilt that you must take blood to survive, and will avoid doing so to the best of your ability. As a result, you often have very little blood in your system which leaves you vulnerable to attack and if not careful, frenzy.`
  },
  'Hard of Hearing': {
    points: 1,
    description: `Although not completely deaf, your hearing is indeed defective. The use of hearing aides will circumvent this flaw, but is frowned upon as a sign of weakness. All hearing related rolls without any prosthetic are increased by 2 difficulty.`
  },
  Hatred: {
    points: 3,
    description: `You have a passionate and unwavering hatred of something. This hate burns bright and is total in its depth. This could be a hatred of a species of animal, class of person, or clan of kindred. You will go out of your way to harm or even kill your hated thing, and gaining dower over the hated subject is the least you will accept.`
  },
  Haunted: {
    points: 3,
    description: `You have been haunted by a spirit that only you (and mediums) can see. This spirit actively dislikes you and does anything it can to make your life hell, especially when you need to keep your cool. It degrades, and belittles almost constantly, and has a limited number of minor tricks it can preform to make others be uncomfortable around you. These minor tricks can only be used 1 time per session, but storytellers are encouraged to use them to screw with the player as that is the intention. These tricks include, Hide a small object, bring a chill wind about you, create a loud buzzing noise that can be heard by all, that appears to emanate from the player, Move small objects like a pen or knife, Break fragile items like bottles or mirrors, trip the character, and make audible eerie noises like wailing, or rattling chains. Yelling at the ghost may drive it away for a while, but it may make you look quite stupid, yelling at thin air and all.`
  },
  Hunted: {
    points: 4,
    description: `You are being hunted by a powerful vampire hunter. This hunter believes you to be an immoral and dangerous monster (maybe you are) who need no longer taint the Earth with your filthy existence. They may even hunt those that associate with you, but you are always priority 1. Something about you just burns them to the core. Storytellers are encouraged to give this mortal some power (often True Faith) to make them more of a threat to the PCs but is not always required.`
  },
  'Hunted Like a Dog': {
    points: 3,
    description: `Whether is be the Blood Hunt, Wild Hunt, or another sects equivalent, you are a wanted person! This sect has called for your head, and will stop at nothing to take it from you. There may be a silver lining to this flaw though, as characters representing other sects may attempt to help you to their gain, and this leaves opportunity to gain new allies.`
  },
  Illiterate: { points: 1, description: `You are totally illiterate, and have no ability to read or write.` },
  Incoherent: {
    points: 5,
    description: `The power of speech is lost to you. Whether born that way or through an irreparable injury, gestures and wheezing are the extent of the "speech" you can produce. The only exception is speaking to animals or telepathy, as your mind knows the words your mouth and throat cannot produce.`
  },

This flaw must be roleplayed at all times.`

It creates discomfort and even pain. You can spend a willpower point to close the eye, but this lasts only 10 minutes and snaps open right after.`
