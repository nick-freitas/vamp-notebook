          Todo: Put pictures or something here later on... There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not
          one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future
          revolves around you, here, now, so do good! Come along, Pond! Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though,
          strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. Frightened people. Give me a Dalek any day. Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was
          young! Oh... is he grey? Come along, Pond! I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. Yes, well, it's a
          brilliant noise. I love that noise. Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first
          to know. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! I never know why. I only know who. You are the
          only mystery worth solving. No idea. Just do what I do: hold tight and pretend it's a plan. Goodbye, Clara. Come along, Pond! Overconfidence, this,
          and a small screwdriver. I’m absolutely sorted. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! It's a fez.
          I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool. No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny. I never know why. I only know who. Bow ties are cool.
          There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. Frightened people. Give me a Dalek any day. Father Christmas. Santa
          Claus. Or, as I’ve always known him, Jeff. There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of
          them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves

          me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your
          silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way.
          Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first. Look at me. No plans, no backup, no
